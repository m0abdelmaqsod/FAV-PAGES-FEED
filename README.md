# Favorite pages feed

**I have developed a Favorite pages feed project for social networking. The project is a platform that allows users, after logging in, to go to the profile page, upload posts, view posts, search, explore, interact, comment, and display notifications to users about interactions with their posts.**
                            
                           
## Project techniques:
`Next.js` | `sass` | `react-icons`
